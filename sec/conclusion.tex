\section{Conclusion} \label{s:conclusion}

As a CNRS researcher, I will, with the collaboration of French and international researchers, continue advancing the understanding of the combinatorial and geometric underpinnings of algebraic topology; allowing with this work the application of the deep ideas of this field in novel contexts -- notably data analysis and condensed matter physics.
Given its core expertise in algebraic topology and its applications (G. Ginot, G. Horel, B. Vallette, and others), the Laboratoire Analyse Géométrie et Applications at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord is an ideal institution to carry through this research program.
