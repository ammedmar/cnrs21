	\noindent\textbf{Abstract:}
	The first story begins with a question of Steenrod.
	He asked if the product	in the cohomology of a triangulated space, which is associative and graded commutative, can be induced from a cochain level product satisfying the same two properties.
	He answered it in the negative after identifying homological obstructions among a collection of chain maps he constructed.
	Using later language, his construction could be said to endow the simplicial chains with an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure.
	The second story also begins with a question: when is a space homotopy equivalent to a topological manifold? For dimensions greater than 4, an answer was provided by the work of Browder, Novikov, Sullivan and Wall in
	surgery theory, which in a later development was algebraically expressed by Ranicki as a single chain level invariant: the total surgery obstruction.
	After presenting the necessary parts of these stories, the goal of this work will be to express the total surgery obstruction associated to a triangulated space in terms of comodules over the $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure build by Steenrod on its chains.
